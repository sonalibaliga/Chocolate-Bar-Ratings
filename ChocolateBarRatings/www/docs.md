## Chocolate Bar Ratings

**About this project**
For this INFO 201 final project, we used the _Chocolate Bar Ratings_ dataset to create an app that presents the user with the perfect list of chocolate companies based on the specifications they provide. In our app, we have two tabs that contribute different information.

Word to the wise, choosing to filter out bean origin in the first interactive tab will limit the results in the table you receive.

On the **first tab**, we ask the user to chose a country or countries they want their chocolate to be available in, cocoa percentage and bean origin (optional). With this information, through filtration, we create a table that lists the chocolate companies that best meet the users needs. With this information, the user is free to make an informed decision on what company would sell their ideal chocolate. We also provide the chocolate ratings given by the dataset.

On the **second tab**, we ask the user to choose a particular category. We create a bar plot that shows that shows the chosen category vs. the ratings. The categories are: Company location, Company (if known), Cocoa Percentage and Bean origin. We took an average of all the different category rating and provide a concise visualization so the user is able to comprehend, for example, which country has the best chocolate ratings or which bean origin has the best chocolate ratings. We provide the top 10.    

**Analysis**
The difference in ratings aren't too dramatic but to a dedicated chocolate enthusiast (whom this app is intended for), even the smallest difference is a big deal.

The highest ratings for **company location** is Chile. In fact, they are the only ones to exceed a 3.5/5 rating. Chile has a surplus of high quality chocolate companies because majority of Chilean desserts involve using chocolate. It has only been a few years since they introduced high quality gourmet chocolate, but despite the short time period, the chocolate has already made a great impression on the locals and those from other countries.

Tobago Estate is the **chocolate company** that has the highest ratings. The company originates in Trinidad and Tobago and was created by a family man, Duane Dove.

Many people tend to prefer chocolate that is 50% **cocoa percentage**. Since this is greatly subjective, further analysis cannot be made. There seems to be no correlation between cocoa percentage and ratings.

For **bean origin**, there were several countries that made it to the top. Something the top countries had in common is that most were from South America. South America has the ideal climate and agricultural space/competition to grow cocoa beans.
